# Spaceman Spiff

Spaceman Spiff is a science fiction hero within the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip, which Bill Watterson wrote and illustrated from 1985 to 1995. 

Spiff is one of Calvin's many alter egos, imaginary personae who have solo adventures (without Hobbes's company) in fantasy worlds which usually have some form of indirect connection with his home or school life. He travels through the galaxy in a red flying saucer with a bubble canopy. In all but one strip, the saucer is tiny, with just enough room for Spiff and apparently little else. Yet, the craft is equipped with an astounding array of weapons, detectors and propulsion devices. Spiff wears square glasses, or goggles, whose front openings change their shape according to his emotions. The galaxy is a cruel place where Spiff is often zapped by ferocious and disgusting aliens (who, in reality, are really people such as Calvin's parents, Miss Wormwood, etc.) or stranded on a desert planet or both. He has a raygun, known by various fantastic names, but in reality, it is merely a water pistol.
